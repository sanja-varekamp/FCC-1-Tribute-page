            <h2>Who Was Arthur C. Clarke? </h2>

            <p>Arthur C. Clarke established himself as a preeminent science fiction and nonfiction writer during the
                mid-20th century. He wrote the novels Childhood’s End and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was adapted into
                a film with Stanley Kubrick. Clarke authored nearly 100 books, and many of his ideas around science had
                links to future technological innovations. Clarke died on March 19, 2008, in Sri Lanka.
            </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>

            <p>Arthur Charles Clarke was born on December 16, 1917, in the coastal town of Minehead in
                southwestern England. The eldest of four children born into a farming family, Clarke became
                fascinated with science and astronomy at an early age, scanning the stars with a homemade
                telescope and filling his head with sci-fi tales from magazines like Astounding Stories.

                After his father suddenly passed away, the financial hardships his family endured precluded
                Clarke from attending university despite his bright, inquisitive mind. After graduating from
                middle school in nearby Taunton, Clarke left home to find work in 1936.
            </p>

            <h2>Early Explorations</h2>

            <p>Arriving in London, Clarke took on a job as a government bureaucrat. He had not lost his
                fascination with the stars, however, and he soon became a member of the British Interplanetary
                Society, which championed the notion of space travel long before it was considered plausible.
                Clarke contributed articles to the group’s newsletter and also began his first forays into
                science fiction.
