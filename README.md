# FCC-1-Tribute-page

This is the first project required for the Responsive Web Design Projects Certificate on freeCodeCamp. It's a tribute page towards a person of our own choosing, so I chose to create a cheeky 90's styled Web page for Sir Arthur C. Clarke. This is the final version of the tribute page which satisfied the requirements of the project, the requirements being certain elements to be present on the page.
